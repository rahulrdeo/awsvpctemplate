This AWS CloudFormation template creates a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) along with associated subnets and routing configurations. It allows you to customize the VPC and subnet settings by providing various input parameters.

Here's a breakdown of what the template does:

1. "Parameters": This section defines input parameters that you can customize when launching the CloudFormation stack. These parameters include things like the VPC CIDR block, the number of private subnets, and availability zones for the subnets.

2. "Conditions": It defines conditions based on the input parameters. For example, it checks whether you want to create one, two, or four subnets based on the value of the `NoOfSubnet` parameter.

3. "Resources": This section defines the AWS resources that will be created when the stack is launched. Here's a breakdown of the key resources:

   - "MyVpcAws": This resource creates the AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with the specified CIDR block, DNS settings, and a name tag.

   - "MySubnet1", "MySubnet2", "MySubnet3", "MySubnet4": These resources create the specified number of private subnets in the VPC, each with its own availability zone and CIDR block. The number of subnets created depends on the value of the `NoOfSubnet` parameter.

   - "MyPubSubnet": This resource creates a public subnet in the VPC, typically used for resources that need direct internet access. It is associated with an Internet Gateway (`MyAwsIgw`) and has a public IP address auto-assignment.

   - "MyAwsIgw": This resource creates an Internet Gateway, which allows resources in the VPC to access the internet.

   - "MyAwsIgwAttach": This resource attaches the Internet Gateway to the VPC.

   - "MyAwsPubRtTab": This resource creates a route table for the public subnet. It is used to direct traffic from the public subnet to the Internet Gateway.

   - "MyAwsRt": This resource creates a default route in the public route table, directing all traffic (`0.0.0.0/0`) to the Internet Gateway.

   - "MyAwsRtPubSubnet": This resource associates the public route table with the public subnet.

   - "MyAwsRtTab": This resource creates a route table for the private subnets.

   - "MyAwsRtSubnet1", "MyAwsRtSubnet2", "MyAwsRtSubnet3", "MyAwsRtSubnet4": These resources associate the private route table with the corresponding private subnets based on the conditions defined earlier.

4. "Metadata and ParameterGroups": These sections provide metadata and parameter grouping for the CloudFormation template to enhance the user interface when creating the stack.

In summary, this CloudFormation template creates a VPC with customizable settings for private and public subnets, routing, and availability zones. The number of private subnets and their associated routing tables depend on the value of the `NoOfSubnet` parameter. This template is useful for setting up networking infrastructure on AWS.
